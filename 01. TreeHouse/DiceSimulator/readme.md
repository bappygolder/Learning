# About: Project Starter Folder

This folder contains a brand new website starter project. This folder gives a quick start to new website/web projects. 

## Getting Started / Usage

1. Download the project
2. Remove this document named ` readme.md ` and located in the project root
3. Remove anything else that you don't want in the project. See **What's In The Project** section for more.
4. Start coading


## Vision

- The goal of this folder is to have all the necessary files, folder structure and plugins included and ready to use. 
- The user will simply have to remove unnecessary files, folders and plugins to get started. 
- We will have to try our best to only include commonly used standerd files, folders and code so that this project remains a lightweight project starting point. 
- We only have a few things included now but our goal will be to continue adding more commonly used assets. 

This will hopefully save unnecessary time when starting a new project. Feel free to suggest or add new things. 

### Further Into The Future

Perhaps we can work towards creating a solution where users can click and choose what they want included in their project starter and we can customize the project before they download and get stared. 


## What's In The Project

### Font Links

An example of Google font (Lato) is included.

### CSS Files

#### [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

We are including the minified version of the Normalize.css.

#### [animsition](#)
#### [slick](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)

Slick adds two different CSS files. 
- `slick.css` is the main css file for the plugin.
- `slick-theme.css` controls various UI elements.

#### [style.css](#)
 
### JavaScrip Links

#### [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

The first 2 links in the `index.html` file are links to jQuery files. One from the CDN and one locally hosted. 
 ```
 	<script
	  src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"
	  integrity="sha256-hVVnYaiADRTO2PzUGmuLJr8BLUSjGIZsDYGmIJLv2b8="
	  crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <!--jQuery CDN-->
	<script src="js_and_plugins/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"></script> <!--jQuery local: use local or CDN remove the other-->

 ```
 We are leaving both in the project for users to choose which one they want to use. Remove one of them for actual project. 
 
#### [animsition](http://git.blivesta.com/animsition/)
 
Animsition adds smooth animation & transaction effects during page load
